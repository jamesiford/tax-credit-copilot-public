# Microsoft 365 channel — decisions

One short entry per decision: context, choice, why.

## D-01 Integration branch is the worktree branch

- **Context.** The brief names `feat/m365-channel` as the integration branch.
  This session runs in a git worktree, and `feat/m365-channel` is checked out in
  the main checkout, which the session must not touch. Both branches point at
  the same commit.
- **Choice.** The worktree branch `jamesiford-m365-capability-layer` acts as the
  integration branch; `wp/CH-nn-*` branches are cut from and merged back into it.
- **Why.** Git refuses to check out one branch in two worktrees. The owner can
  fast-forward `feat/m365-channel` to this branch when ready; nothing is pushed.

## D-02 Python 3.14 for the local `.venv`

- **Context.** The brief prefers Python 3.12; only 3.13 (arm64) and 3.14 are
  installed here.
- **Choice.** `.venv` is built with `py -3.14`.
- **Why.** Newest available ≥ 3.12. CI and production stay on 3.12; no code in
  this work depends on a 3.13+ feature.

## D-03 Facts keep the producer's own types

- **Context.** `ToolResult.facts` must hold "canonical values". The existing
  queries return money as strings (claims layer), integers and floats (credit
  math, headcount), and nested dicts.
- **Choice.** Facts are exactly what the existing query or tool returned, in its
  own key order. Nothing is converted on the way in. `to_dict()` is the stable
  wire form (sorted keys, `Decimal` as its string, dates as ISO). The numeric
  guard canonicalises a fact with `Decimal(repr(value))` for floats and
  `Decimal(value)` for ints and numeric strings (`format.to_decimal`).
- **Why.** The portal narrator is handed `json.dumps(facts, indent=2)` and its
  prompt must stay byte-for-byte identical; converting at the boundary would
  change it. `repr` is the shortest round-tripping string, so `12.67` stays
  `12.67`.

## D-04 Test seams instead of edited tests

- **Context.** The existing suite patches `api.claims._client_book`,
  `_footprint`, `_priceable_states` and `api.claims.portfolio_v2`, and imports
  `_KINDS`, `_INSTANCE_CAP` and `_is_ambiguous` from `api.findings`. CH-01 moves
  that logic into `application/`.
- **Choice.** No existing test was edited (only `test_architecture.py` gained
  rules). `portfolio_page` takes its three external readers as parameters that
  default to the real ones, and `api.claims.portfolio_v2` passes its own
  module-level names; `book_rank` takes a `page_reader`, which `api.chat._book_brief`
  fills with the router function. `api.findings` re-exports the moved names.
- **Why.** The done-when says the existing chat, claims, scope and trend tests
  stay unchanged. The seams are small, named and covered by the equivalence tests.

## D-05 The portal's eligibility brief reads the pay-period average explicitly

- **Context.** `_pipeline_eligibility` called `chat_client_context` with no
  method, so it has always read `pay_period`; the scope's method selector never
  reached it. The channel's `client_eligibility` defaults to `min_max`.
- **Choice.** The chat passes `method="pay_period"` to the capability, with a
  comment. The capability honours `min_max` and `pay_period`, and maps `both` to
  `pay_period`.
- **Why.** "Chat output must not change." Whether the selector *should* reach
  this brief is a product question for the owner.

## D-06 Discovery scoping differs between the chat and the capability

- **Context.** `discover_credits` takes no client, so the chat's `discovery` and
  `multi_state` answers scan the configured default tenant even though the
  capability text says "for the selected client".
- **Choice.** `discover_credits` gained optional `account_id` and `tax_year`
  (default `None` = old behaviour). `client_discovery(client_id=...)` scopes by
  them; the chat passes no client, preserving its output.
- **Why.** Fixing the chat silently would change its answers on a live lakehouse
  that cannot be verified here. The channel must not read another client's
  payroll, so it scopes. Recommend the owner decide whether the chat should too.

## D-07 Situation facts include the client name; the narrator brief does not

- **Context.** The REST endpoint returns the situation plus `client_name`; the
  chat narrator has only ever received the query result.
- **Choice.** `client_situation(...).facts` equals the endpoint body. The chat
  pipeline drops `client_name` before building the narrator prompt.
- **Why.** Both promises hold: equivalence with the endpoint, and an unchanged
  narrator prompt.

## D-08 Employee-level tools are marked sensitive

- **Context.** The catalog marks `employee_drill` sensitive. `findings_list`
  (instance findings carry an employee id in `evidence`) and `client_at_risk`
  (the cohort rows carry employee ids) also return them.
- **Choice.** Both are `sensitive: true`, and their blocks name no employee.
- **Why.** Employee ids must not reach prompts or telemetry; the flag lets the
  gateway and orchestrator treat these results accordingly.

## D-09 `on_run` hook on the chat tools

- **Context.** Provenance needs the run a figure was read from, but adding a key
  to `chat_client_trend` / `chat_jobs_at_risk` / `chat_client_context` would
  change the JSON the narrators receive.
- **Choice.** Each takes an optional `on_run` callback, called with the Gold run
  row. `_support.RunCapture` collects it.
- **Why.** No extra Gold read, no change to any brief.

## D-10 Two simulate functions

- **Context.** The chat's what-if is the straight-line prototype
  (`tools.simulation.simulate_hiring`, city and count, default tenant). The
  catalog's `simulate` is the location what-if (`SimulateUnitQuery`).
- **Choice.** `simulate` is the location what-if; `simulate_headcount` wraps the
  chat tool and carries a warning that it is not client-scoped.
- **Why.** One function cannot honestly serve both; the catalog name stays the
  client-grade one.

## D-11 One statute-refusal mapping

- **Context.** `ClientRunNotAvailable` means either "statute not authored" or
  "no run holds this".
- **Choice.** `_support.refusal` maps messages naming a rule pack, an unmapped
  state or ADR-005 to `YearNotAuthored` and the rest to `NotCalculated`.
  `_support.statute` resolves statute and raises `YearNotAuthored` outright.
- **Why.** The queries carry the distinction only in the message; changing their
  exception types is outside CH-01.

## D-12 Writes are declared as prepare/commit pairs

- **Context.** DESIGN-AND-PLAN §5 lists seven write tools; §5's safety rules make
  each two steps.
- **Choice.** The catalog declares `<tool>_prepare` (`write_prepare`) and
  `<tool>_commit` (`write_commit`) for each, all `implemented: false`, plus
  `verify_figures`.
- **Why.** The audit schema and orchestrator can name them now; CH-05 builds them.

## D-13 Findings code moved verbatim, dead branch dropped

- **Context.** `api/findings.findings` held a `continue` followed by an
  unreachable block.
- **Choice.** The move kept every reachable line and dropped the unreachable one.
- **Why.** Pure move; behaviour identical, and the equivalence test compares the
  endpoint to the capability on the synthetic payroll.
